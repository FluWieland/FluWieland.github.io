{% include base_path %}

I am working as Research Assistant and PhD Student in the Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Claudio R. Nigg at the [Institute of Sport Science](https://www.ispw.unibe.ch/) at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), Switzerland.

I am interested in Psychology, Data Science, Programming, Nutrition, Sports and Science in general to focus on improving my skills to give the best support in my job.<img alt="alt_text" width="1080px" height="720px" src="images/asics.jpeg" />


I do enjoy being in Nature and one of my biggest hobbies having fun. <img alt="alt_text" width="1080px" height="720px" src="images/paraAmis.jpg" />

If any opportunity or contact I am happy to answer through any social platform.

Have a nice day!
